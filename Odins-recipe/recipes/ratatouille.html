      <h4>Steps to Take</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Prep your ingredients before you start, peel and cut the onions into
          wedges, then peel and finely slice the garlic. Trim the aubergines and
          courgettes, deseed the peppers and chop into 2.5cm chunks. Roughly
          chop the tomatoes. Pick the basil leaves and set aside, then finely
          slice the stalks.
        </li>
        <li>
          Heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a large casserole pan or saucepan over a
          medium heat, add the chopped aubergines, courgettes and peppers (you
          may need to do this in batches) and fry for around 5 minutes, or until
          golden and softened, but not cooked through. Spoon the cooked veg into
          a large bowl.
        </li>
        <li>
          To the pan, add the onion, garlic, basil stalks and thyme leaves with
          another drizzle of oil, if needed. Fry for 10 to 15 minutes, or until
          softened and golden.
        </li>
        <li>
          Return the cooked veg to the pan and stir in the fresh and tinned
          tomatoes, the balsamic and a good pinch of sea salt and black pepper.
        </li>
        <li>
          Mix well, breaking up the tomatoes with the back of a spoon. Cover the
          pan and simmer over a low heat for 30 to 35 minutes, or until reduced,
          sticky and sweet.
        </li>
        <li>
          Tear in the basil leaves, finely grate in the lemon zest and adjust
          the seasoning, if needed. Serve with a hunk of bread or steamed rice.
        </li>
